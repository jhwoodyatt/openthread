# Introduction #

Insert verbiage here.

## Requirements Language and Conventions

(EDITOR: Insert boilerplate about RFC 2119 here.)

The layout diagrams in this document that show encodings of data in octet sequences use the convention described in Guide for Internet Standards Writers [@?RFC2360] section 3.1, Packet Diagrams. Specifically, bits in octets are indexed from most significant to least significant, and the least significant bit in a field representing an integer value more than one bit in length is the least significant bit of a the signed or unsigned number, as the case requires.
